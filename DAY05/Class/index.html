    1. Loops are used for repetitive tasks. <br>
    2. We’ll use loop constructor’s given by JS to do repetitive tasks. <br>

    For Loops:

    1. A for loop is best when we know how many time we need to loop/iterate a block of code.
    2. We can nest while loops inside another.
    3. We also can use multiple counters in one for loop.

    While loops:

    1. While loop is best, When we don’t know how much time our loop will run but we know a condition, based on which our loop will run.
    2. It runs as long as given condition is true.

    Do while loops: 

    1. do while loop runs at least once before checking the condition.

    Infinite loops:

    1. It occurs when we skip the condition in the for loop. or we give a condition that is always returns true. in those cases the loop will never end, resulting with an error
